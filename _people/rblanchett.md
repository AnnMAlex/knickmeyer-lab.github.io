### Bio

After graduating from Williams College with a degreee in physics, teaching high school chemistry for a year in Mexico, and obtaining a master's in nanoscale simulation and biomaterials at Northwestern, I joined this awesome lab for computational neuroscience! I'm all about nonlinear life trajectories, which is fair, since the brain is nonlinear too.

### Research Interests

What does deep learning have to say about how the brain works? (How does deep learning work?) What is the most fruitful and insightful way to conceptualize the brain?
