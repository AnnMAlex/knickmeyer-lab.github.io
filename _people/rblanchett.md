### Bio

I graduated from Kalamazoo College and joined the Genetics and Genome Sciences program at Michigan State University. I work primarily computationally and love being a part of the Knickmeyer lab. I study brain structure and function using twins and explore the topic in the context of X-effects.

### Research Interests

I am very much intersted in the brain as well as psychiatric disorders. I love genetics and am excited to keep learning as I work through my PhD.
