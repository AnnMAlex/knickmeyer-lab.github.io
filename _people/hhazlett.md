Dr. Hazlett is a licensed psychologist with a background in child neuropsychology and with research interests in neurodevelopmental disorders. During the last ten years, Dr. Hazlett’s primary research interests have focused on brain development in autism and fragile X syndrome, using brain MRI scans to conduct studies of brain structure and maturation. Her work involves the use of specialized image analysis tools to examine how brain development in children with autism and related disorders compares to typical brain development. These methodologies allow Dr. Hazlett to investigate how variations in brain development influence behavior and development, and conversely, in what ways behavior may shape the trajectory of brain growth. In combination with the brain MRI data, Dr. Hazlett’s work involves developmental and psychological assessments to test relationships between brain and cognition. Currently, Dr. Hazlett is the principal investigator (or collaborator) on several projects using neuroimaging to study the brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome. In addition to her research activities, Dr. Hazlett participates in a multi-disciplinary clinic conducting evaluations for autism spectrum disorders and co-supervises a pediatric neuropsychology clinic.
