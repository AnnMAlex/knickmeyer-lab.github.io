[Rebecca Knickmeyer](https://iq.msu.edu/rebecca-knickmeyer/) is an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics and Human Development within the College of Human Medicine. Her research focuses on understanding how genetic and environmental factors influence the development of brain morphometry, anatomical and functional connectivity, and cognitive and emotional function in infancy and early childhood. She has a particular interest in mechanisms underlying sexual differentiation of the brain and the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Dr. Knickmeyer received her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Cambridge (U.K.) and completed her postdoctoral training in the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
