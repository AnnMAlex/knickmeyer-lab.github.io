Dr. Jessica Girault is a developmental neuroscientist studying the neurobiological mechanisms that shape individual differences in cognition and behavior during infancy and toddlerhood. She received her doctorate in Neuroscience from UNC Chapel Hill under the mentorship of Dr. John Gilmore. As a T32 Postdoctoral Fellow at the CIDD, Dr. Girault will work with data collected as part of the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) investigating the brain development of infants at high familial risk for developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Dr. Girault will focus on deriving neurobiologically-based subgroups of infants and toddlers, with the ultimate goal of identifying specific brain phenotypes associated with the development of dimensional behavioral profiles in ASD
